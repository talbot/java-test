# Word counter interview assignment

Create a simple SpringBoot service, which counts the words.
You need to create two endpoints with Spring MVC:
- An endpoint, which receives a word.
- An endpoint, which returns how many times the word has been counted.

Write tests for the service.

The code contains boilerplate code for the SpringBoot application and test environment.
